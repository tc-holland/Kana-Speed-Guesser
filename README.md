# Kana-Speed-Guesser
A helpful learning tool to practice active recall of Japanese kana characters, in both Katakana and Hiragana sets. Users can choose between three options of flashcard sets, followed by a time selection. Highscores of kana characters guessed within the time limit will be tracked. Any characters that were skipped during the game will be visible at the end, along with their romaji solutions. The GUI relies predominantly on the Pygame library.

I hope to add combined kana and kanji guessing sets in future development. I am currently working on adding more result displays and metrics to the end screen. Additionally I hope to condense the draw functions into a more object oriented class system.
